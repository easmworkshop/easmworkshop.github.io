									<h2>EASM 2017</h2>
									<p>2nd International Workshop on Event Analytics using Social Media Data<br />
								</header>
								<p><i>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.icwsm.org/2017/index.php">THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL AAAI CONFERENCE ON WEB AND SOCIAL MEDIA (ICWSM-17) </a> </i> <br />
								.</p>
								<p>Social media channels enjoy many advantages over traditional media channels, such as ubiquity, mobility, immediacy, and seamless communication in reporting, covering and sharing real-world events, e.g., the Boston bombings, the NBA finals, and the U.S Presidential elections. Given these advantages, social media posts such as tweets can typically reflect events as they happen, in real-time. Despite these benefits, social media channels also tend to be noisy, chaotic, and overwhelming. As a result, the vast amount of noisy social media data poses tremendous challenges for conducting in-depth analysis, which is critical to applications for event playback, journalistic investigation, storytelling, etc. 

								The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers that are working in a variety of areas that are all related to the larger problem of analyzing and understanding events using social media responses, to discuss: 1) what are the recently developed machine learning and data mining techniques that can be leveraged to address challenges in analyzing events using social media data, and 2) from challenges in analyzing events, what are the practical research directions in the machine learning and data mining community. 
							</p>
							<h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
								<p>We encourage submissions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:</p>

								<a href="mailto:yurulin@pitt.edu" class="icon fa-envelope" target="blank"><span class="label">Email</span></a> is an assistant professor at the School of Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh. Her research interests include human mobility, social and political network dynamics, and computational social science. She has developed computational approaches for mining and visualizing large-scale, time-varying, heterogeneous, multi-relational, and semi-structured data. Her current research focuses on extracting system-level features from big data sets, including social media data and anonymized cellphone records, for studying human and social dynamics, particularly under exogenous events such as emergencies and media events. Her work has appeared in prestigious scientific venues including WWW, SIGKDD, InfoVis, ACM TKDD, ACM TOMCCAP, IEEEP and PLoS ONE.</p>
